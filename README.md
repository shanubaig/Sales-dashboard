Excited to share my latest Sales Dashboard - Monthly built in Power BI!

This dashboard provides clear insights into:
📊 Total Sales, Profit, Discounts, and Quantity
📅 Monthly sales trends across different categories and sub-categories
🏷 Comparison of sales by Category & Sub-Category
👥 Top Customers by Sales Contribution

The goal of this dashboard is to enable data-driven decision making by helping businesses track performance, identify high-performing categories, and analyze customer contributions effectively.

I really enjoyed working on this project as it strengthened my skills in:
✅ Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
✅ SQL (Data Preparation & Querying)
✅ Excel (Data Cleaning.
